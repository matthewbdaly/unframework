Unframework is not a framework. It's an opinionated collection of off-the-shelf PHP components and some very basic glue to stick them together for cases where you don't want to use a full framework.

It's also a learning experience in how to build a small framework from scratch.

Installation
------------

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist matthewbdaly/unframework myapp
```
